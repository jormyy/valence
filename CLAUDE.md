## Architecture

**Valence** is a sports stream aggregator for NBA, NCAAB, MLB, ATP, and WTA. It shows live and upcoming games and lets users watch embedded streams.

### Data flow

- **Game/schedule data** — fetched at request time from ESPN's public scoreboard API (`lib/espn.ts`). No API key required. Revalidates every 60s. 5 leagues in parallel:
  - NBA: `site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/nba/scoreboard`
  - NCAAB: `site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/mens-college-basketball/scoreboard`
  - MLB: `site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/baseball/mlb/scoreboard`
  - ATP: `site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/tennis/atp/scoreboard`
  - WTA: `site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/tennis/wta/scoreboard`

- **Stream links** — fetched live from the stream providers in `lib/streams/`. Team names are fuzzy-matched against provider event listings. No local storage of stream data.

- **Stats** — fetched per-game from ESPN's summary API on demand when viewing the Stats tab.

### API routes

- `GET /api/games?date=YYYYMMDD` — returns all games with stream counts
- `POST /api/streams` — returns streams for a selected game lookup payload
- `GET /api/stats/{gameId}` — returns stat leaders for a specific game

### Key files

- `lib/game.ts` — `scoreView()` helper for score display logic
- `lib/scope.ts` — `applyScope()` and `statusCounts()` filtering helpers
